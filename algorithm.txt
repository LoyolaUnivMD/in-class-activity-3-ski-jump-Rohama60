1,Prompt the user to enter the hill type (normal, large).
2,Read the input hillType from the user.
3,Prompt the user to enter the par value.
4,Read the input par from the user.
5,Initialize variables height, pointsPerMeter, and distance.
6,If hillType is "normal":
 - Set height to 46.
 - Set pointsPerMeter to 2.0.
 - Set distance to 90.
7, Else, if hillType is "large":
 - Set height to 70.
 - Set pointsPerMeter to 1.8.
 - Set distance to 120.
8, Otherwise:
 - Set height, pointsPerMeter, and distance to 0.
9, Calculate points using the formula:
10, If distance is greater than par, set points to 60 plus the difference between distance and par times casted pointsPerMeter to int.
11, Else, set points to 60.
   -  Print the hill type and total points earned.
12, If points is greater than or equal to 61:
   -  Print "Great job for doing better than par!".
13, Else, if points is less than 10:
   -  Print "What happened??".
14, Else:
